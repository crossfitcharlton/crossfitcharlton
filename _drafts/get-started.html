    <h2>Book an Intro</h2>
    <p>First, we'll give you a quick tour of the facility. Then, 
      we will sit down and answer any questions you might have 
      about who we are and how we train. Some common questions might be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do I have to be in shape to join?</li>
      <li>What kind of results can I expect?</li>
      <li>How often should I come?</li>
      <li>What membership plan is right for me?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Then we can determine the next best steps 
      customized to your goals, needs, and fitness 
      level. Either way, this is a great starting 
      point and you will leave here with some great advice. 
      Expect to spend an hour at our gym. Most of all, 
      your first visit is a great way to determine 
      if our gym is a good fit for you.</p>
