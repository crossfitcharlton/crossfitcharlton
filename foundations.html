      <h2>Foundations</h2>
      <p>Our Foundations course is designed to introduce new members to CrossFit in small 
        group classes. Our expert staff will help you build a solid foundation, with 
        workouts focusing on bodyweight exercises and introductory weight training. 
        These classes focus on proper technique to build the skills necessary 
        for long term growth (Description courtesy of CrossFit, LLC).</p>

      <h2>What to expect?</h2>
      <p>During these classes, our  coach will introduce important concepts 
        for each foundational movement on CrossFit. You'll learn how to perform the 
        exercises safely and effectively, including the range of motion and scales of 
        the movement. This is followed by a CrossFit Workout that will leave you feeling 
        accomplished, energized, and ready to come back for more!</p>

      <p>When you're ready, you'll graduate into our regular CrossFit classes 
        and continue to meet new milestones on your fitness journey.</p>
